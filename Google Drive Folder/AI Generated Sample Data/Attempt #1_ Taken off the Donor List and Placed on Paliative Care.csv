"7,1,""Dr. Shaw: """"The organ lottery is over, and you didn't win. In fact, you've been disqualified."""" Patient: """"Disqualified for what?""""

I am truly sorry."""" Patient: """"What did I do wrong?"""" Dr. Solis: """"You did nothing wrong. You have been a warrior. This disease is the problem, not you. Our job now changes from fighting the disease with surgery, to fighting for your comfort and peace. And we have an entire team—the palliative team—to help us do just that."""""",Feeling at fault, but then profoundly validated."
"84,5,""Dr. Ekwensi: """"I have some hard news to deliver today. Can I sit with you? (sits down) The transplant is not going to be possible. And I know that's a tremendous blow."""" Patient: (silent, staring ahead) Dr. Ekwensi: """"I can't imagine what's going through your mind. There are no right or wrong things to feel. What I can promise you is that we are not going anywhere. Our focus just pivots to a new mission: your absolute comfort. I'd like to tell you about our palliative care partners."""""",Numb and in shock, but not abandoned."
"85,5,""Dr. Al-Jamil: """"The board made its decision. And I'm sitting here with you now, and I'm so sorry that the news isn't what we prayed for. A transplant is off the table."""" Patient: """"So I'm dying."""" Dr. Al-Jamil: """"That's a very real fear to have, hearing this news. Palliative care is not about dying. It's about living. It's about making sure that the time you have is good time. We are going to focus on life, and they will help us."""""",Terrified, but gently and honestly redirected."
"86,5,""Dr. Benning: """"I wanted to make sure we had plenty of time, because this is a hard conversation. The transplant board has decided against surgery."""" Patient: (crying) """"It's not fair."""" Dr. Benning: """"You are absolutely right. It is not fair. And it is completely okay to be angry and to grieve this. This is a loss. My team and I are here with you. And we're going to bring in more help—our palliative team—to make sure you are wrapped in support."""""",Enraged and grieving, but given full permission to feel."
"87,5,""Dr. Solis: """"Thank you for seeing me. I have an update from the transplant team, and my heart breaks to tell you this. They've determined we can't proceed."""" Patient: """"What about my family?"""" Dr. Solis: """"That's an important question. The palliative care team is not just for you; they are for your family, too. They provide emotional and spiritual support for everyone involved. We will care for all of you."""""",Worried about others, but reassured about family support."
"88,5,""Dr. Ekwensi: """"I've been thinking about you and your journey. I have the board's decision, and it's not the one we hoped for. They said no to the transplant."""" Patient: """"I feel so empty."""" Dr. Ekwensi: """"That makes perfect sense. A future you were planning for has been taken away. We need to honor that feeling. And when you're ready, we can start to talk about what we can build in its place: a plan for comfort, for dignity, and for peace, with the help of our palliative friends."""""",Experiencing deep loss, but given hope for a different kind of future."
"89,5,""Dr. Al-Jamil: """"I know this is an appointment you've been dreading. The committee has concluded that a transplant is not in your best interest. I'm so very sorry."""" Patient: """"So you're just... giving up."""" Dr. Al-Jamil: """"I want to be very clear. We are not giving up on you. We are giving up on a strategy that won't work. We are starting a new one, one focused entirely on your well-being. The palliative team will be the quarterback of this new plan."""""",Feeling abandoned, but this was strongly and compassionately corrected."
"90,5,""Dr. Benning: """"The news I have is heavy, and I want you to know I'm here to help you carry it. The transplant is not going to happen."""" Patient: """"I don't know if I can do this."""" Dr. Benning: """"I know it feels that way now. But you are not alone in this. I'm right here. Our nurses are right here. And we are going to introduce you to the palliative team, who are masters of providing strength and support when you feel you have none left."""""",Overwhelmed and fearful, but immediately offered partnership and strength."
"91,5,""Dr. Solis: """"I asked your nurse to be here with us for this conversation. We have the decision from the transplant committee, and they have decided against the surgery."""" Patient: (shaking head in disbelief) Dr. Solis: """"I know this is a shock. This is not the end of our road together. It's a fork in the road. We will now walk a path that is dedicated to your comfort and peace, and we will bring in the palliative specialists to guide us."""""",In denial, but surrounded by a calm and present care team."
"92,5,""Dr. Ekwensi: """"This is a moment that changes things. And I am so sorry that I have to be the one to share it. The transplant is no longer an option for you."""" Patient: """"Just tell me what to do."""" Dr. Ekwensi: """"For today, you don't have to do anything but breathe. We will handle the rest. We will cancel the things that no longer serve you and we will arrange a gentle introduction to our palliative team, whose only job is to listen to you and support your goals."""""",Shutting down and looking for direction, but given space and gentle guidance."
"93,5,""Dr. Al-Jamil: """"I can see the worry on your face. I'm afraid the news I have will not ease it. The transplant board has said no. And for that, I am truly sorry."""" Patient: """"What happens if the pain gets bad?"""" Dr. Al-Jamil: """"That is exactly what we will focus on. You will not be in pain. I promise you. The palliative care team are the world's leading experts in pain and symptom control. Your comfort is now our number one priority."""""",Anxious about the future, but a specific fear was addressed and allayed."
"94,5,""Dr. Benning: """"I have the decision about the transplant. Before I tell you, I want to say that your courage has been an inspiration."""" Patient: """"Just tell me."""" Dr. Benning: """"They said no. They feel your body is not strong enough to survive it. I am heartbroken for you. Our next conversation will be with the palliative team, and it will be all about your wishes, your hopes, and your goals from this day forward."""""",Bracing for impact, but treated with immense respect and focused on future agency."
"95,5,""Dr. Solis: """"The news is not good. The transplant isn't going to happen. And I know there are a million questions and feelings that come with that statement."""" Patient: """"I just feel... tired."""" Dr. Solis: """"'Tired' is a very real and valid feeling. It makes sense. We are going to change our plan to honor that. Our palliative team helps us create a care plan that gives you more good days and fewer tiring ones. We will focus on energy preservation and peace."""""",Exhausted and weary, but had their feelings directly acknowledged and addressed in the new plan."
"96,5,""Dr. Ekwensi: """"I'm here to talk about the transplant, and I want to start by saying we're in this together, no matter what. The committee has decided it's too risky to proceed."""" Patient: """"I feel like I'm floating."""" Dr. Ekwensi: """"That's a very common feeling when you get world-shifting news. Our job is to be your anchor. We, along with our new palliative care partners, will keep you grounded and make sure you have everything you need, one day at a time."""""",Dissociated and unreal, but offered a grounding presence and a one-day-at-a-time approach."
"97,5,""Dr. Al-Jamil: """"I came as soon as I heard. The transplant board's final decision is no. I know that is a punch to the gut. I am so, so sorry."""" Patient: (crying) """"I tried so hard."""" Dr. Al-Jamil: """"You did more than try; you fought a heroic battle. This outcome is not a reflection of your effort. Now, we change the battle plan. We are now fighting for comfort, for joy, for moments with family. And our palliative care squad are the special forces for that mission."""""",Feeling like a failure, but their efforts were praised and the goal was reframed heroically."
"98,5,""Dr. Benning: """"This is a conversation I never want to have, and I am so sorry we are here. The transplant is not going to be possible."""" Patient: """"My kids..."""" Dr. Benning: """"Let's talk about them. Our palliative team has counselors and child life specialists who can help you talk to them. We will help you navigate this as a family. You are not alone in this."""""",Immediately worried about family, and that specific concern was met with a concrete offer of specialized support."
"99,5,""Dr. Solis: """"I have the decision. And I'm going to be with you every step of the way as we process this. The decision is no."""" Patient: """"I don't believe it."""" Dr. Solis: """"I know it's hard to accept. We don't have to solve everything today. Our only goal today is to get through this moment. Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to the palliative doctor, and we'll slowly start to talk about what comes next. But today, we just sit with this."""""",In disbelief, but the pressure to process quickly was removed, allowing space for the emotion."
"100,5,""Dr. Ekwensi: """"I've been given the difficult task of sharing the transplant committee's decision. They've decided against surgery. I'm here for you, and I'm not going to rush this."""" Patient: """"What does my life even look like now?"""" Dr. Ekwensi: """"That is the most important question. And the answer is: it will look like what you want it to look like. Our palliative care team's entire job is to help you answer that question and then make it a reality. We will focus on your goals."""""",Disoriented and questioning everything, but was immediately empowered to define their own future goals."
