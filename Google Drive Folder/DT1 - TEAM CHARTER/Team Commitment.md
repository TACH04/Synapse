# Charter

**Team Charter**

## 1\. Mission Statement

Our team's mission is to collaboratively design, develop, and validate an innovative biomedical device that addresses a critical unmet clinical need. We will operate with integrity, creativity, and rigorous engineering principles to deliver a solution that is safe, effective, and has the potential to positively impact patient care.

## 2\. Recognition of Common and Individual Strengths

    Shared Team Strengths: Our team is united by a strong work ethic, a diversity of engineering perspectives (mechanical, electrical, software, and materials), and a collective proficiency in creative problem-solving. We are all committed to a hands-on approach to prototyping and testing.

## 3\. Individual Strengths & Leveraging:

        Tanner Hochberg (Systems Engineer): Possesses strong leadership and organizational skills, with a talent for seeing the "big picture" and ensuring all subsystems integrate seamlessly. These strengths will be leveraged to guide project strategy, manage timelines, and serve as the central point of communication.

        Elijah Don (Electrical Engineer): Has detailed knowledge of circuit design and sensor integration. This expertise will be critical for developing the electronic hardware and ensuring data is acquired accurately and reliably.

        Alex Roussas (Software Engineer): Is highly proficient in Python and embedded systems programming. This will be leveraged to write clean, efficient code for device control, data processing, and user interface development.

        Ian Marcon (Mechanical Engineer): Brings advanced skills in SOLIDWORKS and rapid prototyping techniques. This strength will be essential for designing the physical enclosure, mechanisms, and ensuring the device is ergonomic and manufacturable.

        Ethan Vanderpool (Materials & Test Engineer): Has a methodical approach to research and experience in developing and executing robust testing protocols. This will be leveraged to select biocompatible materials and to rigorously verify that our device meets all technical specifications.

## 4\. Role Expectations

    Project Lead / Systems Engineer (Tanner Hochberg): Facilitates team meetings, manages the project schedule (Gantt chart), coordinates tasks across roles, and serves as the primary point of contact for instructors and external advisors. Ensures the overall system architecture is sound and all components function together.

    Electrical Engineer (Elijah Don): Responsible for the design, prototyping, and testing of all electronic components, including power management, sensor selection, and PCB layout. Leads quality control checks on all electrical hardware.

    Software Engineer (Alex Roussas): Responsible for all firmware and software development, including algorithm design, version control (Git), and software validation. Manages regulatory considerations related to software as a medical device (SaMD).

    Mechanical Engineer (Ian Marcon): Leads the physical design, CAD modeling, and fabrication of the device. Responsible for material selection in consultation with the Materials Engineer. Manages the Design History File (DHF) and all related documentation.

    Materials & Test Engineer (Ethan Vanderpool): Leads the development and execution of the verification and validation test plans. Researches and recommends materials based on biocompatibility, durability, and cost. Oversees risk management activities, including the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA).

    Shared Responsibilities: All team members are responsible for contributing to brainstorming, problem-solving, documentation, and presenting team progress.

## 5\. Conflict Resolution Protocols

    Absence Reporting: Planned absences (e.g., interviews, appointments) must be communicated to the Project Lead via the team's communication channel (e.g., iMessage) at least one week in advance. Unforeseen absences must be reported as soon as possible. The team member is responsible for coordinating with others to ensure their tasks are covered.

    Creative Disagreement Resolution: Professional disagreements are encouraged as part of the design process.

1. Members will first attempt to resolve the issue through open, data-driven discussion.  
2. If a consensus cannot be reached, the matter will be put to a majority team vote.  
3. The Project Lead will act as a tie-breaker if necessary.

    Appeal Process and Escalation Pathway: If a conflict remains unresolved or involves interpersonal issues that cannot be solved internally, it will be escalated to the course facilitators, TAs, and instructors for mediation.

## 6\. Charter Amendment Process

    Procedure for Changes: Any team member may propose an amendment to this charter by adding it to the agenda for the next weekly team meeting. The proposed change will be discussed by the entire team.

Amendments to this charter require a supermajority for approval, defined as a "yes" vote from at least four of the five team members.
