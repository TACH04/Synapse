\justifying
Our BME 417 capstone team, in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, is developing a large language model (LLM) aimed at improving empathy and communication skills in healthcare providers. This LLM will help doctors reflect on challenging patient interactions and receive feedback to enhance the overall patient experience.[a]


During this DT period, our team made significant strides in early development. Each member is actively building foundational knowledge in LLM implementation through a PyTorch course, and we are receiving mentorship from Dr. Asif, our faculty supervisor, who has also granted us access to ASU’s supercomputing infrastructure. To better understand the clinical context and potential use cases, we conducted a stakeholder interview with a Mayo Clinic physician. This provided invaluable insights into the functional requirements and helped inform the direction of our need-finding process. Each team member has contributed a list of need statements, which we are currently compiling and evaluating to determine the most relevant and impactful project scope. We have also created a GitHub repository to manage all collaborative coding and documentation.


At this stage, our team is still finalizing the core functionality of the LLM. Although Mayo Clinic has expressed strong interest in a post-interaction feedback tool, we have not yet locked in this direction. We continue to assess our compiled needs before committing to a specific use case. One confirmed decision, however, is our adoption of GitHub for version control and communication.


The learning curve associated with LLM development has been a challenge, but it is being addressed through technical upskilling and consistent team discussions. Additionally, some initial ambiguity around end-user needs was clarified through stakeholder engagement. These early-phase obstacles have improved our understanding of the technical, clinical, and user-centered dimensions of the problem space.


Looking ahead to the next DT period, we plan to finalize and prioritize our need statements to establish clear project boundaries. We aim to begin developing a prototype aligned with the chosen need, while maintaining regular communication with Mayo Clinic stakeholders to ensure our efforts remain clinically relevant and actionable.
