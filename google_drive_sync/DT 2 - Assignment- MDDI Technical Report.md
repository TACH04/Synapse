Introduction


This report analyzes the growing sector of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, with a specific focus on AI-powered communication coaching for medical professionals. This sector is directly relevant to our capstone project with the Mayo Clinic, which aims to develop an AI and machine learning-based communications coach. This tool is designed to train medical residents and practitioners in empathetic communication, such as delivering difficult news. The characteristics of this sector, including its rapid growth, technological advancements, and increasing emphasis on patient-centered care, directly align with our project's goal of improving physician-patient interactions through technology.


Industry Context


The AI in healthcare market is experiencing significant growth, with a global market size estimated at 26.57 billion in 2024, and it is projected to reach 187.69 billion by 2030. North America currently holds the largest market share at over 54% [1]. Within this landscape, our project occupies a niche focused on medical education and professional development. Typically, communication skills training for physicians has relied on methods like role-playing with actors, which can be expensive and time-consuming [2].
Emerging trends indicate a significant shift towards solutions driven by technological advancements. AI and machine learning are being increasingly integrated into medical education to provide personalized and scalable training [3], [4]. A key trend is the use of AI-powered virtual patients and simulations to create realistic and low-stress environments for medical students and residents to practice their communication skills [5], [6]. These platforms can provide immediate and objective feedback, a significant advantage over traditional methods.
Furthermore, the integration of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) is becoming more prevalent, offering immersive learning experiences that can enhance empathy by allowing practitioners to experience situations from a patient's perspective [7], [8], [9]. This aligns with a broader industry push towards improving patient outcomes and satisfaction, where effective and empathetic communication is key. Our project, by leveraging AI to provide a sophisticated communication coach, is positioned at the front of this educational transformation within the healthcare sector. The demand for healthcare data scientists and professionals skilled in AI is also projected to grow significantly, indicating a positive employment landscape for the technologies and expertise central to our project [10], [11].
