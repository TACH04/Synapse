Brainstorming Plan
Brainstorming Plan: AI for Medical Empathy Training
Brainstorming Leadership
* Designated Leader: Ian Marcon
* Justification for Selection: Ian was picked because he is organized and is able to make most meetings, so he is able to collect extensive notes on brainstorming sessions. He also pushes for all voices to be heard and for people to speak up about new ideas whenever they have them. He is also focused and can create an environment that is both fun and on track.
* Leader's Responsibilities:
   * Facilitating all brainstorming sessions and enforcing the ground rules set up for group success.
   * Managing the session's time to ensure the planned agenda is followed and that all possible ideas can be made and discussed.
   * Encouraging equal and active participation from every team member and pushing for each voice to contribute at least once to each topic.
   * Taking detailed notes about the ideas that are discussed and sharing them to the group for later reference.
   * Preparing any necessary materials that could be helpful to the meeting before each session.
   * Guiding the team through both idea generation and idea evaluation phases to come to agreement on which ideas are preferred and not preferred.
Method Selection
* Mind Mapping is a great visual tool to help brainstorm and then evaluate all the parts of this project from a central concept. We can create main branches for topics that we know will be deeply involved in our project then branch out from there with greater specifics. This also allows us to generate a large quantity of ideas and see the connections between them.
* Another brainstorming method is the six thinking hats method. We can use this method for structured evaluation of our ideas. This ensures we analyze our top ideas from multiple perspectives:
   * White Hat: Focus on the data and facts. What technology do we need?
   * Red Hat: Focus on emotions and intuition. How would a user feel using this? Is this feature frustrating or empowering?
   * Black Hat: Focus on risks and caution. What are the potential failure points or ethical risks?
   * Yellow Hat: Focus on benefits and optimism. What are the biggest advantages of this approach?
   * Green Hat: Focus on creativity and new ideas. How can we overcome the challenges identified by the Black Hat?
   * Blue Hat: Focus on process and control. What are our next steps? Are we following the process?
Session Structure
* Give every idea possible and cast the widest net. There are no bad ideas in idea generation and that should be reflected in our brainstorming sessions.
* Every idea is just as important, even if something feels far flung. If you never give it a chance there is a possibility you have abandoned a really good idea.
* Met up for at least 30 minutes every two or three weeks. This gives us plenty of time to work on idea generation and evaluation.
* Minimum of one idea per person for all times we go through idea generation. If someone hasn’t talked in a while Ian will encourage them to speak.
* Keep criticism constructive. Do not give basic or insulting criticism for any idea when going through evaluation.
* Don’t get butt-hurt if your idea doesn’t come out on top. Even if your idea wasn’t picked, the input was still valuable.
Documentation Strategy
* Zoom will be used for most meetings so all meetings will be recorded so that we can go back later to get details on what everyone said.
* Meeting notes will also be taken so that the big overarching ideas of the meeting are easily accessible and distributed.
* Each brainstorming meeting will be given a category based on the meeting's purpose and notes will be stored based on those categories.
