Part 1: Survey/Interview Strategy Section
1.1 Introduction: Target Populations and Rationale
Our project is the development of a Machine Learning (ML) Communications Trainer, a tool designed to enhance crucial communication skills for healthcare professionals in a safe, simulated environment. Based on our initial needs analysis, the success of this device is critically dependent on understanding the distinct needs, workflows, and challenges of its primary users. Therefore, this research strategy targets two core stakeholder populations:
1. Medical Trainees (Medical Students and Residents): This group represents the foundational user base. They are in a critical developmental phase, learning the affective and technical aspects of medical communication. Their feedback is essential for designing a core learning experience that is effective, engaging, and builds a strong empathetic foundation. They require a low-risk environment to practice and receive objective feedback, which our tool aims to provide.
2. Practicing Clinicians (Doctors and Nurses, particularly in Palliative Care/Hospice): This group represents the advanced user. They face the daily realities of difficult conversations, practitioner burnout, and empathy erosion. Their insights are vital for developing features that support career-long professional development, manage emotional fatigue, and address the nuances of communicating with diverse patient types. Understanding their workflow constraints and desire for confidential, ongoing feedback will ensure the tool has long-term utility and adoption potential.
By focusing on both trainees and experienced practitioners, we can design a scalable platform that serves as both a foundational educational tool and a resource for continuous professional growth, thereby maximizing its impact on the healthcare system.
1.2 How Information Will Inform Design Decisions
The insights gathered from these stakeholders will be the foundation of our user-centered design process. The findings will directly inform:
* Core Feature Prioritization: Feedback will determine which features are "must-haves" versus "nice-to-haves." For example, if trainees overwhelmingly request feedback on non-verbal cues while practitioners prioritize strategies for managing emotional conversations, we can construct the system to support both.
* Simulation Content Development: Stakeholder input on the most challenging conversation scenarios (delivering terminal diagnoses, handling patient anger, navigating cultural differences) could guide the creation of useful and relevant training simulations.
* User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design: Understanding the workflow, time constraints, and needs of our users will dictate the UI/UX. The interface will likely have to be intuitive, efficient, and create an emotionally comfortable space for users to be vulnerable and receptive to feedback.
* Feedback Mechanism Design: Interview data will clarify the most effective way to deliver objective, quantitative feedback. This includes the format (dashboards, transcripts with annotations, video playback), timing (real-time vs. post-session summary), and specific metrics (empathy score, clarity of language, pacing).
1.3 Survey/Interview Methodology
To gather data, we will employ a mixed-methods approach combining online surveys and one-on-one interviews.
* Delivery Method:
   * Online Surveys (Google Forms): A broad survey will be distributed to capture quantitative data and qualitative insights from a larger sample of both populations. This allows for trend identification.
   * Virtual or In-Person Interviews: Follow-up, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a smaller, selected group. This method is crucial for exploring the reasoning behind survey responses, gathering detailed stories, and understanding complex emotional and workflow nuances.
* Setting: Surveys can be completed at the participants' convenience. Interviews will be scheduled to respect the demanding schedules of clinicians and trainees, conducted virtually to remove geographical barriers.
* Anticipated Challenges:
   * Participant Availability: Clinicians and residents have extremely limited time. We will accommodate this by keeping surveys under 10 minutes and offering flexible scheduling for interviews.
   * Privacy Concerns: The topics of burnout and communication skill gaps could be sensitive. We will emphasize the confidentiality and anonymization of data.
1.4 Ethical Considerations
Upholding ethical standards is critical to our product development.
* Informed Consent: All participants will be provided with a clear, concise consent form before participation. It will detail the study's purpose, the voluntary nature of participation with the right to withdraw at any time, how data will be used and stored, and contact information for the research team.
* Privacy and Confidentiality: All survey data will be collected anonymously. Data will be stored on a secure server with limited access.
* Bias Mitigation: Questions have been reviewed to eliminate leading language. Our sampling strategy will aim to include participants from diverse specialties, experience levels, and healthcare settings to ensure a representative population and avoid bias.

Part 3: Data Analysis Plan
3.1 Analysis Approach
Our analysis will aim to extract relevant and actionable insights.
* For Quantitative Data (Scaled, Multiple Choice, Yes/No):
   * Descriptive Statistics: We will calculate means, frequencies, and percentages to summarize responses and establish an understanding of user needs and preferences.
   * Comparative Analysis: We will compare the responses of Trainees vs. Practicing Clinicians. This will highlight how needs evolve from training to practice, informing design.
   * Correlation Analysis: We will investigate relationships between variables, such as correlating "years in practice" with "perceived value of a burnout-reduction feature," to identify user needs.
* For Qualitative Data (Open-ended responses):
   * Thematic Analysis: We will use an analytical approach to identify recurring themes, patterns, and insights from open-ended questions. These insights will be clustered using diagramming to visually group related concepts and reveal intricate needs.
   * Jobs-to-be-Done Framework: We will analyze qualitative data through the JTBD lens to define the core "jobs" users are trying to accomplish. This focuses design on outcomes rather than just features.
   * Quote Extraction for Design Justification: Critical quotes will be extracted and compiled to serve as "voice of the user" evidence to justify and inspire specific design decisions throughout the project.
3.2 Conflict Resolution and Unexpected Insights
* Conflict Resolution: If conflicting feedback arises between the groups, we will prioritize by impact on the core goals (learning and well-being). We will seek compromise solutions, such as making scoring an optional feature, and if necessary, conduct targeted follow-up questions to resolve the conflict. All design trade-offs and thought-processes will be documented.
* Unexpected Insights: We will hold a review of incoming responses to actively look for surprising patterns or challenging assumptions. Interesting responses will be flagged for follow-up in interviews or further analysis. This ensures we remain open to discovering needs not captured in our initial analysis, potentially reshaping our design approach.
